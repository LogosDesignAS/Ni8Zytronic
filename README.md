# Ni8Zytronic

Author: Logos Payment Solutions and Originally developed by Zytronic

This Git repo contains the Zytronix ZXY500 128 Linux driver build for X86 and source files customized to build in buildroot for ARM.

The original driver is from Zytronic (ZXY500 128 Input Controller): https://www.zytronic.co.uk/support/downloads/ 

For now the driver is built with debug functionality, which can be disabled later for lower code size.
